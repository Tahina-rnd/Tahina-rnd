- âš¡ Fun fact: The name of the Python programming language has nothing to do with the snake! It is actually inspired by the British television series Monty Python's Flying Circus. The language's creator, Guido van Rossum, was a big fan of the show and thought the name "Python" was "unique, mysterious, and short".
